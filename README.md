PRODIGY INFOTECH INTERNSHIP🚀

VIRTUAL 4 WEEKS/ 1 MONTH🌐

MY DOMAIN - WEB DEVELOPMENT✅

💠OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAMME - As a Web Development intern, we will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and develop valuable skills that will
prepare us for our future career. This program is designed to challenge us, support our growth, and provide us with a meaningful and rewarding experience.

💠TASK 02: STOPWATCH WEB APPLICATION ---
To build a stopwatch web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, you can create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.

💠KNOWLEDGE GAINED ---
Creating a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript helps build foundational web development skills. You learn to structure web pages using HTML elements like <div> and <button>, and apply styling with CSS for layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. JavaScript is used to add interactivity—handling events like button clicks and controlling timing using functions like setInterval() and clearInterval(). It also teaches important concepts like DOM manipulation, time formatting, function logic, and state management. Overall, this project gives hands-on experience with real-time updates, user interaction, and organizing code effectively.
